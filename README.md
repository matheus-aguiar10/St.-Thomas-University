This folder contains the final project during the MSc Big Data Analytics, Fundamentals of Big Data Analytics course at St. Thomas University. 

Nowadays, data analysis is increasingly being used in sports such as basketball, soccer, baseball, and among others. 
The use and collection of data in basketball is bringing major changes in the way teams hire players and also in the game strategy. 
Millions of dollars are invested in this sport every year and the team owners want to get it right to have a better result in the championships. 
The more wins a team has, the more attractive it becomes for possible sponsorships. 
In addition, fans will consume more products from the brand and will go to the stadium to watch games, generating even more revenue for the team. 
To minimize the mistakes of directors during the recruiting process and in the strategies used, data analysis is essential. 
We can analyze the game quality and performance of players, such as number of points per game, assists, rebounds, height, weight, age, and position to direct signings according to the needs of each team. 
Big data in sports can change the game in several ways, including helping players, coaches and other team members, promoting wins, and contributing to the success of the team. 


PROBLEM QUESTION:
According to the player's position, which variables have more value and should become a reference to maximize the probability of success in hiring new players?

BACKGROUND:
For this project, I will be using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball with structured data. 
This dataset contains information from the first NBA season, 1946-47 to 2021-22. 
It contains general details from teams, such as name, city, founding date, stadium, drafts, players attributes (height, weight, age, salary) and also game statistics for each player (rebounds, points, assists, season experience, etc).


HYPOTHESIS

1- Does a team's payroll positively influence the percentage of wins?

2- The taller the player, the greater the chance of being chosen among the first in the draft?

3- Do taller players make more points and rebounds than shorter players?

4- Do shorter and lighter players give more assists and score more points?

5- Does a higher average team age negatively influence the percentage of wins?

6-Â  Does a player's number of points, assists or rebounds positively influence his salary?


Also, it will be developed a model to predict if a player is a good to choice to hire or not by each position.
